## ⚙️ Webpack Configuration

The application uses a custom Webpack setup with the following key features:

### Custom Rules
- **SVG Processing**: Converts SVGs to React components with `@svgr/webpack`
- **Asset Optimization**: Efficient handling of images and fonts with content hashing
- **TypeScript/JSX**: Babel compilation for modern JavaScript features

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are supported:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development|production
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api  # API endpoint
APP_VERSION=1.0.0                       # Application version
```

### Code Splitting & Optimization
- **Vendor Chunks**: Separate bundles for node_modules
- **Redux Bundle**: Dedicated chunk for Redux-related code  
- **Emotion Bundle**: Separate styling library bundle
- **Dynamic Imports**: Lazy loading for improved performance

### Key Configuration Features
```javascript
// webpack.config.js highlights
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    '@components': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/components'),
    '@store': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/store'),
    // ... other aliases
  }
},
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: { /* vendor libraries */ },
      redux: { /* Redux-related code */ },
      emotion: { /* Emotion styling */ }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue tones for main actions and branding
- **Secondary**: Green accents for success states  
- **Accent**: Red tones for warnings and destructive actions
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds
- **Dark**: Deep grays for dark theme implementation

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (web font)
- **Scales**: xs (12px) to 4xl (36px)
- **Weights**: Normal (400) to Bold (700)
- **Line Heights**: Optimized for readability

### Spacing System
- **8px Grid**: Consistent spacing using 8px base unit
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Logical**: xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl scale

## 🔧 API Documentation

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Components**: Testing rendering, user interactions, and props
- **Redux Logic**: Testing actions, reducers, and sagas
- **Utilities**: Testing helper functions and services

### Test Coverage
Current test coverage focuses on:
- Critical user workflows (CRUD operations)
- Component rendering and interaction
- State management logic
- Error handling scenarios

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode  
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is optimized for static hosting platforms:

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with optimized assets:
- Minified JavaScript and CSS
- Content-hashed filenames for caching
- Separated vendor and application bundles
- Compressed assets for faster loading

### Deployment Platforms
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist/` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your Git repository
- **GitHub Pages**: Use the built assets
- **S3 + CloudFront**: Upload to AWS S3

- **Emotion styling system**: Custom theme and component designs
- **Business logic**: All CRUD operations, pagination, and form validation written manually
- **Testing suite**: Test cases and assertions written without AI assistance

### Verification Process
1. **Code Review**: Every AI-generated line was reviewed and understood
2. **Manual Testing**: Extensive manual testing of all features
3. **Debugging**: Issues resolved through manual debugging and problem-solving
4. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis and optimization done manually
